It varies corona's lives depending on the country so some coutries are even difficult workout.
I've been doing yoga , let's say "as a yoggy" more than 10 years. Even my yoga sutudio had to close during quarantine.

My yoga teacher has created online yoga studio immediately. Lucky for me I didn't miss any oppotunities of my workout because of her.
At the biggining of onlin studio, I felt a little bit wired because basically doing yoga with friends , teacher but doing yoga at my apartment by myself is kinda lonly and I felt isolated from the world. Sounds like over reacted but truth is it does.
Tha't why I've been thinkig I wanna make something to connect all yoga loves.
